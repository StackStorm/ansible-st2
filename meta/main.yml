# "Fake role" meta which allows installing `ansible-st2` via ansible-galaxy.
# All the project roles are located under the 'roles' dir.
# See why: https://github.com/StackStorm/ansible-st2/issues/45
#
# `ansible.cfg` workaround to find stackstorm roles:
#
# [defaults]
# roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles/:/etc/ansible/roles/StackStorm.stackstorm/roles/
