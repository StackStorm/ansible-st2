## Variables

Below is the list of variables you can redefine in your playbook to customize st2 deployment:

| Variable                 | Default       | Description  |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| **st2repo**
| `st2repo_name`           | `stable`      | StackStorm PackageCloud repository to install. [`stable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/stable/), [`unstable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/unstable/), [`staging-stable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/staging-stable/), [`staging-unstable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/staging-unstable/)
| **st2**
| `st2_version`            | `latest`      | StackStorm version to install. `present` to install available package, `latest` to get automatic updates, or pin it to numeric version like `2.2.0` or with revision like `2.2.0-1`
| `st2_config`             | `{}`          | Hash with StackStorm configuration settings to set in [`st2.conf`](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2/blob/master/conf/st2.conf.sample) ini file.
| `st2_system_user`        | `stanley`     | System user from which st2 will execute local/remote shell actions.
| `st2_system_user_in_sudoers` | `yes`| Add `st2_system_user` to the sudoers (recommended for most `st2` features to work).
| `st2_ssh_key_file`       | `/home/{{st2_system_user}}/.ssh/{{st2_system_user}}_rsa` | Path to `st2_system_user` SSH private key. It will be autogenerated by default.
| `st2_auth_enable`        | `yes`         | Enable StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_auth_username`      | `testu`       | Username used by StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_auth_password`      | `testp`       | Password used by StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_save_credentials`   | `yes`         | Save credentials for local CLI in `/root/.st2/config` file.
| `st2_rbac_enable`        | `no`          | Enable RBAC. |
| `st2_rbac`               | [See `st2_rbac` variable in role defaults](roles/st2/defaults/main.yml) | RBAC roles and assignments. This is a dictionary with three keys `roles`, `assignments`, and `mappings` (based on LDAP group membership). `roles`, `assignments`, and `mappings` are arrays. Each element in the array follows the exact YAML schema for [roles](https://docs.stackstorm.com/rbac.html#user-permissions), [assignments](https://docs.stackstorm.com/rbac.html#defining-user-role-assignments) defined in ST2 documentation. [mappings](https://docs.stackstorm.com/rbac.html#automatically-granting-roles-based-on-ldap-group-membership) are slightly different, they use a `name` and a `mapping` key, see [./roles/StackStorm.st2/defaults/main.yml](./roles/StackStorm.st2/defaults/main.yml) for an example.
| `st2_ldap_enable`        | `no`          | Enable LDAP authentication backend. |
| `st2_ldap`               | [See `st2_ldap` variable in role defaults](roles/st2/defaults/main.yml) | Settings for LDAP authentication backend. `st2_ldap` is a dictionary and has one item `backend_kwargs`. `backend_kwargs` should be provided as exactly listed in ST2 documentation for [LDAP configuration](https://docs.stackstorm.com/authentication.html#ldap).
| `st2_packs`              | `[ st2 ]`     | List of packs to install. This flag does not work with a `--python3` only pack.
| `st2_python_packages`    | `[ ]`         | List of python packages to install into the `/opt/stackstorm/st2` virtualenv. This is needed when deploying alternative auth or coordination backends which depend on Python modules to make them work.
| **st2web**
| `st2web_version`     | `latest`      | st2web version to install. `present` to install available package, `latest` to get automatic updates, or pin it to numeric version like `2.2.0` or with revision like `2.2.0-1`.
| `st2web_ssl_certificate`     | `null` | String with custom SSL certificate (`.crt`). If not provided, self-signed certificate will be generated.
| `st2web_ssl_certificate_key` | `null` | String with custom SSL certificate secret key (`.key`). If not provided, self-signed certificate will be generated.
| `st2web_nginx_config`     | `null` | String with a custom nginx configuration file (`st2.conf`). If not provided, the default st2.conf will be used.
| **st2chatops**
| `nodejs_major_version`   | `14`          | The default fits st2chatops version >= 3.5.0.
| `st2chatops_version`     | `latest`      | st2chatops version to install. `present` to install available package, `latest` to get automatic updates, or pin it to numeric version like `2.2.0` or with revision like `2.2.0-1`.
| `st2chatops_st2_api_key` |               | st2 API key to be updated in st2chatops.env using "st2 apikey create -k" in a task
| `st2chatops_hubot_adapter` |             | Hubot Adapter to be used for st2chatops. Default is `shell`, but should be changed to one of the [`supported adapters`](`https://github.com/StackStorm/ansible-st2/blob/master/roles/st2chatops/vars/main.yml`).[**Required**]
| `st2chatops_config`      | `{ }`         | Based on adapter in `st2chatops_hubot_adapter`, provide hash for the adapter settings, to update [`st2chatops.env`](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2chatops/blob/master/st2chatops.env). For example, for `Slack` hubot adapter: `st2chatops_config:` `HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN: xoxb-CHANGE-ME-PLEASE`
| `st2chatops_version`     | `latest`      | st2chatops version to install. Use `latest` to get automatic updates or pin it to numeric version like `2.2.0`.

## Examples

Install latest `stable` StackStorm with all its components on local machine:

```sh
ansible-playbook stackstorm.yml -i 'localhost,' --connection=local
```

> Note that keeping `latest` version is useful to update StackStorm by re-running playbook, since it will reinstall st2 if there is new version available.

This is default behavior. If you don't want updates - consider pinning version-revision numbers.

Install specific numeric version of st2 with pinned revision number as well:

```sh
ansible-playbook stackstorm.yml --extra-vars='st2_version=2.2.0 st2_revision=8'
```

## Installing behind a proxy

If you are installing from behind a proxy, you can use environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` in the playbook. For the st2smoketests, you will need to disable proxy for localhost.

```yaml
  environment:
    http_proxy: http://proxy.example.net:3128
    https_proxy: http://proxy.example.net:3128
    no_proxy: 127.0.0.1,localhost
```

## Developing

There are a few requirements when developing on `ansible-st2`.

These are the platforms we must support (must pass end-to-end testing):

* Ubuntu Bionic
* Ubuntu Focal
* CentOS7
* RockyLinux8
* RHEL7 (via AWS)
* RHEL8 (via AWS)

Must also support Ansible Idempotence (Eg. Ansible-playbook re-run should end with the following results: `changed=0.*failed=0`)

For development purposes there is [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) available. The following command will setup ubuntu18 box (`ubuntu/bionic64`) by default:

```sh
vagrant up
```

Other distros:

```sh
vagrant up ubuntu20
vagrant up centos7
vagrant up rockylinux8
```
