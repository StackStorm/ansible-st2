## Supported platforms
* Ubuntu Trusty (14.04)
* Ubuntu Xenial (16.04)
* RHEL6 / CentOS6
* RHEL7 / CentOS7

> If you're using the provided Vagrantfile, note that it uses Xenial by default. Due to some of the changes there, Vagrant 1.9.1 or better is required.

## Requirements
At least 2GB of memory and 3.5GB of disk space is required, since StackStorm is shipped with RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Mongo, nginx and OpenStack Mistral.

## Installation
```sh
# stackstorm
ansible-playbook stackstorm.yml
```

## Variables
Below is the list of variables you can redefine in your playbook to customize st2 deployment:

| Variable                 | Default       | Description  |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| **st2repo**
| `st2_pkg_repo`           | `stable`      | StackStorm PackageCloud repository to install. [`stable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/stable/), [`unstable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/unstable/), [`staging-stable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/staging-stable/), [`staging-unstable`](https://packagecloud.io/StackStorm/staging-unstable/)
| **st2**
| `st2_version`            | `latest`      | StackStorm version to install. Use latest `latest` to get automatic updates or pin it to numeric version like `2.1.1`.
| `st2_revision`           | `1`           | StackStorm revision to install. Used only with pinned `st2_version`.
| `st2_system_user`        | `stanley`     | System user from which st2 will execute local/remote shell actions.
| `st2_system_user_in_sudoers` | `yes`| Add `st2_system_user` to the sudoers (recommended for most `st2` features to work).
| `st2_ssh_key_file`       | `/home/{{st2_system_user}}/.ssh/{{st2_system_user}}_rsa` | Path to `st2_system_user` SSH private key. It will be autogenerated by default.
| `st2_auth_enable`        | `yes`         | Enable StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_auth_username`      | `testu`       | Username used by StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_auth_password`      | `testp`       | Password used by StackStorm standalone authentication.
| `st2_save_credentials`   | `yes`         | Save credentials for local CLI in `/root/.st2/config` file.
| **st2mistral**
| `st2mistral_version`     | `latest`      | st2mistral version to install. Use latest `latest` to get automatic updates or pin it to numeric version like `2.1.1`.
| `st2mistral_db`          | `mistral`     | PostgreSQL DB name for Mistral.
| `st2mistral_db_username` | `mistral`     | PostgreSQL DB user for Mistral.
| `st2mistral_db_password` | `StackStorm`  | PostgreSQL DB password for Mistral.
| **rabbitmq**
| `rabbitmq_erlang_cookie` | `st2-mq`      | RabbitMQ security string to permit to communicate with each nodes in a cluster

## Examples
Install latest `stable` StackStorm with all its components on local machine:
```sh
ansible-playbook stackstorm.yml -i 'localhost,' --connection=local
```

> Note that keeping `latest` version is useful to update StackStorm by re-running playbook, since it will reinstall st2 if there is new version available.
This is default behavior. If you don't want updates - consider pinning version-revision numbers.

Install specific numeric version of st2 with pinned revision number as well:
```sh
ansible-playbook stackstorm.yml --extra-vars='st2_version=2.1.1 st2_revision=8'
```

## Developing

There are a few requirements when developing on `ansible-st2`:

These are the platforms we must support (must pass end-to-end testing):
- Xenial
- Trusty
- CentOS6
- CentOS7
- RHEL6 (via AWS)
- RHEL7 (via AWS)

Must also support Ansible Idempotence (Eg. Ansible-playbook re-run should end with the following results: `changed=0.*failed=0`)
